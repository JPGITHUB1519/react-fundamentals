- You should always add PropType validation to your component

- Implicit Binding
- Explicit Binding
- new Binding
- window Binding

- When you have a simple component without state and only return some UI and have some props, use Stateless Functional Components


Trick to see the state on the screen
    { JSON.stringify(this.state.repos, 2, null)}


To avoid cannot Get <route> error on browser:

    Add this property on webpack:
        devServer: {
            historyApiFallBack: true
        },
    This will redirect all the routes to /
